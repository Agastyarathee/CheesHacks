Adventist Christian Fellowship - Madison,"Hey there, we are so glad you've visited our page! We are UW-Madison students who at some point in our lives started to ask deep questions and wonder about God and such things, and then experienced that God is actually a loving and good God, and, thus, we really want to share with others the life-changing power of the Bible here, on campus, in our busy, everyday lives, which can be full of problems, worries, and struggles. Why is it cool?) The acronym ""ACF"" explains it very well, though it may seem hard to understand at first: A - Adventist. Adventists emphasize that the imminent second coming (""advent"") of Jesus gives hope to each one of us because this will be the day when our whole life, regardless of how it was, can be made perfect, and we can become fully happy, just as God planned it to be. C - Christian. Christians know that Jesus loved each person, each identity, and each individual so much, that He decided to give up everything (including His life) so that we may be restored, and our lives - fulfilled. This focus on His amazing love is something that can truly change your life and ours. F - Fellowship. We all have a deep longing for a community and fellowship, and no one likes to feel alone or excluded, though this often happens on such a big campus as ours. But when we get to know God's love, we are so filled with it that we naturally tend (and are able) to share this gift with our community, while being focused on Jesus. No community becomes more united than the one where God is at the center.  Still wondering what all these words like ""God's love"", ""fulfillment"", ""true community"" or ""belonging"" mean? Come and join our next event, and you'll figure it out! If you have any questions about our organization, please email Slava C. (primary contact) at cherempei@wisc.edu.","Address Address Contact Email

"Alpha Phi, Iota Chapter","The founding members formed Alpha Phi in the 1870s, during an era when women faced great opposition to pursuing a higher education. Ten brave, intelligent women from Syracuse University in New York gathered to combat this discrimination and find support among peers. In 1872, they created the Alpha Phi Fraternity (the term “sorority” did not emerge until a few years later). Our founders of dreamed of a vibrant future for Alpha Phi by instilling the values of Sisterhood, Scholarship, Service, Leadership, and Loyalty. The ambition and vision of our revolutionary founders thrives today through the actions and dedication of Alpha Phi’s 200,000 collegiate members nationwide and 173 chapters throughout the United States and Canada. The Iota chapter of Alpha Phi has a long tradition at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It was founded in 1896. Today Alpha Phi is a community of vibrant women who strive for strong sisterhood and community. Alpha Phi is a group of students dedicated to scholarship and the Greek Community!","Address

"Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity, Kappa Chapter","Alpha Sigma Phi is not interested in only becoming the fraternity of choice, for this perspective unnecessarily narrows our recruitment efforts to those inclined to go Greek. We instead, will be focused on appealing to a broader base of undergraduate men, thereby competing directly with other activities and organizations on today’s campuses. By so doing, we help to ensure that we attract and recruit the very best and brightest undergraduate men.

We have chosen to define our Fraternity as a co-curricular organization to underscore our desire to partner with the institutions which host our chapters in their endeavor to prepare their students for success after college.

Relevant, Replicable, and Recognizable: organizationally, we cannot reach our vision if the products and services we offer are not relevant to our customers, replicable across chapters and across time and recognizable as ours so as to be discernible from our competition. These “Three Rs” will become the litmus test against which we will allocate resources in the months and years to come. ","Address

We want to create a safe space where people interested in the well-being of animals can come together as a community regardless of dietary choices or beliefs.  In addition to social events, a core part of our programming is the Animal Ethics Fellowship in which members are split into groups and a facilitator guides them through a curriculum over the course of 5–8 weeks. The curriculum covers topics such as moral circle expansion, veganism, animal advocacy as a social justice issue, the pros and cons of the field of ""effective animal advocacy,"" invertebrate welfare, and wild animal welfare.  It's not required to be an ""animal lover"" to be a part of our group. (Although, if you are an animal lover, we'd be more than happy to have you. 😄) We think that the moral arguments for ending oppression and suffering, wherever they occur, shouldn't be arbitrarily restricted to members of our own species, and you don't have to be someone who enjoys the company of animals or someone who is fascinated by animals to be an advocate for them. We accept anyone into our organization regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, ability, background, and personal dietary choices.

Badger Hunting Club,"Our Mission: To unite the hunting community at UW-Madison, to promote and create new hunters, and to engage UW students in the importance and benefits of hunting. The Badger Hunting Club was founded in 2006 as a social club to unite the hunters at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The club has evolved quite a bit since then, but our mission remains the same.  The Club accomplishes this by doing much of the leg work for hunters who may be unfamiliar with the Madison area.  We have locations of which we have permission to deer hunt, both with a gun and with a bow, as well as information on the public land in the area. We have members involved in all types of hunting, including: deer, turkey, waterfowl, pheasant, small game, and even members that have never hunted before and just want to learn! Aside from offering great opportunities for our members, we do our best to preserve the hunting heritage of America, and specifically of Wisconsin.  We are active in promoting and sponsoring Learn to Hunt programs for novice hunters, teaching hunter safety classes, and exposing non-hunters to the joys and benefits of hunting. We try to portray hunting in a different light in order to break down some of the stereotypes people have about hunting by being active in habitat conservation, as well as viewing hunting as a means of acquiring sustainable, organic meat. Also, we are very active in helping our property owners manage their properties through providing working parties and helping out as needed. We also hold social events and wild game dinners for members in order to share in others successes.","Address

We believe that polarization is damaging our country and causing young people to either
disengage from democracy or radically engage by fitting a partisan mold. Democracy is in
danger if the next generation is disengaged and polarized because young people are the future
of our country.
The purpose of BridgeUSA is to build a BridgeUSA community — one in which students from
across the ideological spectrum can engage as a group working together to understand — to
bridge — the various perspectives behind the important political and social issues of our time.

Catalysts for Science Policy,"Want to get involved, or just learn more? Email us at casp.uw@gmail.com Check out our website to read about upcoming events, join the listserv, or become a member!  Mission Statement The CaSP Organization has three main goals:  Science policy is a broad field that requires a general understanding of science, but also how policies are established in the government, private and nonprofit sectors. There is a lack of understanding of what science policy is and how it affects both public policy and scientific research. In order to fulfill our goal of educating students about science policy, we will have public seminars where invited speakers will present on various aspects of science policy. In addition, we wish to keep our student members updated on current science policy issues by holding meetings where we informally discuss these issues in a journal club setting. Being in the capital provides us with an amazing opportunity to work with senators and law makers. We hope to organize a relationship with the capital that affords graduate students the opportunity to meet policy makers and understand how policies involving science are managed and implemented from the policy makers’ perspective. In order to increase the awareness of science policy as a career, several seminars with invited and local speakers will be organized during the year. Through these seminars the graduate student community will be exposed to different careers and jobs in different sectors: government, private and non-profit. Science policy issues affect scientists and the general public alike. For this reason, we believe that it is important for the public to understand the value of research and science.  To address this goal, we will reach out to the community and educate them on currently relevant science topics.  Through activities geared toward the non-scientific community, both in the local neighborhoods and on the University campus, we hope to demonstrate why the research done by graduate students at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is important to the community at large. These activities will provide our members with experience communicating science topics to a general audience.  Non-technical communication is a skill that is indispensable for scientists, especially those interested in science policy, where scientists frequently interact with a variety of non-scientific audiences.

Challabration,"Challabration is a club that is devoted to creating a community around baking challahs and other desserts weekly in preparation for Shabbat. Every Thursday during the semester, the University of Wisconsin Hillel will provide dough for students to braid, incorporating the flavor of the week, as well as supplying the ingredients for the dessert of the week which will be served for Shabbat dinner at Hillel the following night. Once students have made their challahs and desserts, we will bake their creations, and students can choose to stay and eat their baked goods fresh out of the oven, take them home, or pick them up the following day. We also can provide students with baking kits so that they can braid and bake challahs in their own kitchens. Some weeks will have themes or activities associated with them, such as embroidering challah covers, painting pumpkins, knitting, and other activities. Holding these weekly baking meetings gives individuals the opportunity to disconnect from all the deadlines and obligations of a college student’s life and destress while focusing on baking with friends for one hour of the week, regardless of their religious identity or background. In addition to serving as a time for mental wellness, Challahbration serves as a social event, where students can easily meet members of the Jewish community or any members of the Madison community who share a love for challah baking. Baking challah weekly creates a community around Jewish values and provides the opportunity for students to preserve traditions from their childhood with the observance of Shabbat. In light of the Jewish value of Tzedakah, our weekly challah bakes are a source of food security for attendees. Furthermore, after students and Shabbat dinner have been provided for, any remaining challah will be donated to food banks in the area.","Address

Chi Psi Fraternity - Alpha Iota,"Alpha Iota of Chi Psi, more commonly known on campus as ‘The Lodge’, has grown into one of the premier fraternities at the University of Wisconsin. One of the longest continuously active fraternities on campus, the Lodge has become a staple of the University and the city of Madison since its founding in 1878. Generations of men look back at their experiences at 150 Iota Ct. as some of the most memorable times in their lives. We at the Lodge continually strive for development and enrichment in our active membership even today, instilling the feelings and traditions of previous members in our current active body. Activity outside of the Lodge is strongly encouraged, and many members are involved on the UW campus and in the local community. Members serve on the IFC Executive boards, serve on student government, participate in pre-professional and academic societies, and participate in club athletics. Many events within the Lodge, prepared and developed by the brotherhood, help to break up the daily grind of academic life. These events include intramural sports teams as well as socials with sororities, all helping to instill valuable personal and life-long skills for our members. Moreover, the Lodge is a force in philanthropic work in the Madison community, from our volunteer efforts at Gio's Garden to the Iota Open golf outing, which has raised thousands of dollars for local charities. Additionally, the Lodge has been very successful in Humorology, having won raising the highest total of funds twice in recent years. Known as ‘Alphas’ of Chi Psi, Alpha Iota has long list of distinguished alumni including the great American historian Stephen E. Ambrose, renowned Milwaukee architect Andrew C. Eschweiler, former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm, the Pabst family from Pabst Brewing Co., and Daily Show producer Ben Karlin. Today, members come from across the country and world finding fraternity life at the Lodge one of the best parts of their college experience. In many ways, the fraternity experience has drifted astray from its founding principles: bettering men and assisting them in the development of their intellectual, moral and social life. These values are what The Lodge is built upon, where we stress the importance of academic excellence, community service, and social tact. We are continually building a better experience for men who seek more out of their University years than the average undergraduate, and we’re searching for a select group of excellent young gentlemen to contribute to that experience.","Address

Choi Tae Kwon Do Club,"Tae Kwon Do, “a Korean martial art, which requires the use of only hands and feet, without weapons” was developed during the years of 1954-55 by General Choi Hong Hi. Its roots lie in the ancient Korean martial arts of Taek Kyon and Subak. The Choi Tae Kwon Do Club of the University of Wisconsin, Madison was started by Drs. Jack Nitschke and Carmen Alonso in 1998. The club provides traditional martial arts training and is dedicated to promoting individual growth through a non-competitive environment. Classes generally are for an hour and a half. The first 30-45 minutes is a workout/warmup which consists of push-ups, sit-ups, and stretching. The remainder of class concentrates on a wide range of Tae Kwon Do technique, as appropriate to the individual’s experience level. The final few minutes of every class are used for meditation/contemplation and announcements. New students interested in joining the club can simply attend one of the scheduled classes in loose fitting, comfortable workout clothing (i.e. sweatpants, sweatshirt). Questions can be emailed to club contacts. Class times: Tuesdays and Thursdays 5-6:30pm, and Sundays 10-11:30am. Class times and locations are posted on our Facebook page.

"Collegiate 4-H, UW-Madison","Collegiate 4-H, UW-Madison shall strive to follow the national motto: “Continuing to Serve, Serving
to Continue."" We will serve the needs of our members, Wisconsin 4-H, and the students of the
University of Wisconsin - Madison in any way we can. We will help build the future leaders of 4-H
through experience in the 4-H program on campus and across the state. Additionally we will follow
the 4-H motto, “To Make the Best Better.” 4-H is the nation’s largest youth development and empowerment organization. In Wisconsin, more than 150,000 young people in urban, suburban, and rural settings are involved with 4-H and other UW-Madison Division of Extension youth programs. Youth ages 5-19 can learn important life skills like leadership, teamwork, critical thinking and communication to help prepare them for successful futures – and they do it while engaging in fun, hands-on 4-H activities. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development’s nearly 13,000 adult volunteers serve as mentors and role models for 4-H’ers. They help provide a safe, interactive place for youth to take risks, practice their independence, and master new skills. Adults who volunteer for 4-H take a lot away from their experiences – volunteers learn and strengthen skills that help them in the workplace and become better connected to their communities. Collegiate 4-H has agreed on a partnership through a Memorandum of Understanding with UW-Madison, Division of Extension Wisconsin 4-H organization. We will be guided by both UW-Madison RSO policies and Wisconsin 4-H policies. We have been granted permission to use the 4-H emblem and logo, as well as have been assigned an advisor from the Wisconsin 4-H office.

Figure Skating Club of UW-Madison,"The Figure Skating Club of UW-Madison (FSCUW) is an entirely student-run organization that offers recreational and competitive figure skating opportunities for UW-Madison students. We operate under the University’s Division of Recreation and Wellbeing and our Governing Body, U.S. Figure Skating. FSCUW is an intercollegiate team that competes against other universities at sanctioned regional and national U.S. Figure Skating Collegiate Competitions.  Our team travels around the Midwest and competes at three regional competitions per season, where skaters can compete in individual and team events. We have a great time bonding as a team, meeting other skaters, and representing our school! We currently do not have a Synchronized Skating team, but we can connect skaters with Wisconsin Inspire’s Collegiate Synchronized Skating Team.  There are no tryouts to be on the team. Currently, we have three weekly club practices (one-hour each). We offer team socials, fundraisers, volunteer events, and leadership opportunities. Additionally, our members have the chance to teach at local Learn to Skate programs.  Though we do not have tryouts, we ask that team members have some background in skating. This is for safety reasons. We have coaches who volunteer their time to help us with skills and competitions but are not there to teach you how to skate. Additionally, we ask that all club members have their own skates. This is because we cannot guarantee that rental skates will be available during our practices. If you cannot meet these requirements but are still interested in skating, we recommend that you sign up for Learn to Skate classes through RecWell or a local ice rink. RecWell has a discounted price for students!","Address

Filipinx American Student Organization,"The Filipinx American Student Organization (FASO) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is a group of students deeply committed to the issues and experiences of Filipinx and Filipinx Americans. FASO aims to educate and spread awareness about Filipinx culture and history, foster friendships, and identify with each other through educational, cultural, and social events and programming. FASO is based on the spirit of Bayanihan; the values of family, community, and exploring one’s sense of self. In 1990, UW-Madison students who were in a Tagalog course began organizing “Tagalog sa Teresa” (“Tagalog at the Terrace”) sessions to engage the Filipino community in Madison. In the fall of 1991, 15 of these Tagalog students officially founded FASO at UW-Madison. These 15 students were considered the largest Southeast Asian language class at the time. These students wanted to connect with all Tagalog students on campus and others interested in learning the Filipino language and culture. FASO has since become an active and very visible student organization on and off of the UW-Madison campus, facilitating numerous events and participating in programs with other university student organizations across the Midwest. FASO facilitates biweekly general body meetings, monthly magkasamas (cultural learning events), an annual Philippine Cultural Night, fundraisers, and much more! FASO strives to be an inclusive student organization, and a family to all students.","Address Address Contact Email

Formula SAE,"Formula SAE is a student design competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE, also known as SAE International). The competition was started back in 1978 and was originally called SAE Mini Indy. The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has contracted a student design team to develop a small Formula-style race car. The prototype race car is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules, whose purpose is both ensuring on-track safety (the cars are driven by the students themselves) and promoting clever problem solving.The prototype race car is judged in a number of different events. The points schedule for most Formula SAE events is:  Formula SAE encompasses all aspects of a business including research, design, manufacturing, testing, development, marketing, management, and fundraising. Formula SAE takes students out of the classroom and puts them in the real world. If you are interested in joining the team or have any questions, please join our Slack workspace here and any slack channels interesting to you! Leaders and members will frequently be posting meeting times and updates. You can also email team leads at eformula@go.uwracing.com for any questions!

If You're Reading This - UW Madison Chapter,"IfYoureReadingThis.org functions to close the gap between students struggling with mental health and the people that care about them by having friends and peers come forward first and share the responsibility of being vulnerable. The website hosts open letters of support from students and faculty to empower students to build or tap into their support networks by identifying the people who understand and want to listen and by erasing the barrier of stigma. Our letters are accompanied with a name and a photo, so that readers know mental health is a topic we should not be ashamed to speak about and should be diligent in caring for, especially in the face of limited or inaccessible mental health services.","Address Address Contact Email

Indian Graduate Students' Association,"The Indian Graduate Students Association (IGSA) was established in 1996 by a group of graduate students from India at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with the aim of bringing Indian culture to the UW-Madison campus. We are a voluntary non-profit organization registered with the student organization office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In the span of eighteen years we have grown into an organization with over 1400 members. Our members belong to different backgrounds and age groups. Membership to our organization is open to all.  Music and dance concerts: We invite renowned artists and performers belonging to different schools and genre of Indian classical music and dance to perform at UW-Madison. Most of the artists we invite are recipients of several national and international awards. These artists could be instrumentalists or vocalists belonging to either of the two main schools of Indian music, Hindustani and carnatic. Through these high quality music and dance concerts, we hope to demonstrate the richness and diversity of Indian culture. Such experiences help enhance the cross-cultural diversity on campus. The concerts are held primarily in the premier auditoriums on campus. Outdoor trips: We organize a Fall Colors camping trip at the peak of the renowned fall color activity in the north woods of Wisconsin. The popularity of this event is shown by the rising numbers every year. This is a wonderful opportunity for students to be a part of a truly Wisconsin experience. We also organize ski trips to ski resorts close to Madison and white-water rafting trips to north Wisconsin.

Social & cultural events: We organize various events like table tennis tournaments, trivia quizzes and other literary events. We also organize cultural events which provide an opportunity for students to showcase their talents. Through these events we aim to present the rich Indian history and ethnic diversity. These events also provide an opportunity to the UW community to witness traditional costumes, and savor authentic Indian cuisine.

Voluntary service to new students: We provide voluntary help to the Indian students new to the Madison campus, to settle down and get acclimatized to UW lifestyle. We help students with temporary accommodation, and conduct several orientation programs for their benefit. ","Address Address Contact Email

"Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. (Beta Omicron Chapter)","Kappa Alpha Psi was founded on the campus of Indiana University on January 5, 1911. The Fraternity's fundamental purpose is achievement. Early in this century, African-American students were actively dissuaded from attending college. Formidable obstacles were erected to prevent the few who were enrolled from assimilating into co-curricular campus life. This ostracism characterized Indiana University in 1911, thus causing Elder W. Diggs, Byron K. Armstrong, and eight other black students to form Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, which remains the only Greek letter organization with its 1st Chapter on the University's campus.

The founders sought a formula that would immediately raise the sights of black collegians and stimulate them to accomplishments higher than they might have imagined. Fashioning achievement as it's purpose, Kappa Alpha Psi began uniting college men of culture, patriotism and honor in a bond of fraternity.","Address

"Lambda Phi Epsilon International Fraternity, Inc.

MISSION: To guide men on a lifelong discovery of authenticity and personal growth. VISION: A world where Lambda men live authentic, fulfilling lives and contribute through the pursuit of their noble purpose. CORE VALUES: Authenticity: Demonstration of one’s true self to the world, despite external expectations. Courageous Leadership: Integrity through action towards a more humane world, especially in times of adversity. Cultural Heritage: Ideas and experiences of a people, transcending the world through generations. Love: Care and respect for oneself, the brotherhood, and the world.

History: Lambda Phi Epsilon was founded on February 25, 1981 on the campus of UCLA by a group of nineteen dedicated men led by principal founder Mr. Craig Ishigo. The goal of the founders was to transcend the limitations faced by traditional Asian American interest organizations on campus. While these organizations were often split along lines of national origins, the founders sought an establishment that drew its membership equally from the different segments of the Asian American community. Their vision was that the members would eventually become the leaders of their respective ethnic communities, and thus, bridge the gaps fragmenting the Asian American community through their affiliation with a common organization.","Address

The Peer Learning Association (PLA) is a professional student organization that coordinates free guided group study sessions that supplement your specific course. All sessions are led by members of our organization (Peer Facilitators) who have completed that course with an exceptional grade. In these sessions, students have the opportunity to challenge their understanding of course material by presenting their knowledge of key topics to their peers in an informal classroom setting. Peers teach one another, and facilitators assist the conversation when necessary. Lecture Managers, who meet weekly with your professor, compose weekly outlines tailored to the key topics most recently covered in your class. Students can use PLA sessions as part of their normal study routine.

How do these sessions look? Sessions are composed of about 5-20 peers/students (subject to change according to student demands per semester) and 1-2 Facilitator(s). Facilitators facilitate discussion of the course material presented by the obtained weekly outlines in a form of questions and peers will have prepared for these sessions beforehand in order to carry out the discussion among one another. Peers will be teaching peers and facilitators are there as an extra resource if the group becomes stuck on a particular subject of their discussion.

Phi Delta Theta-Wisconsin Alpha Chapter,"Phi Delta Theta was built on three pillars that haven’t budged an inch since the Fraternity was founded by “The Immortal Six” way back in 1848 at Miami University. The pillars are: The cultivation of friendship among its members, the acquirement individually of a high degree of mental culture, and the attainment personally of a high standard of morality. Shortened, we refer to the principles as friendship, sound learning and rectitude. Helping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person’s true self, and by learning from each other’s strengths while helping to improve each other’s weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his own. Rather than try to find young men to “mold” into some ideal, we celebrate the uniqueness of each individual and, through encouragement, values, example and brotherhood, empower every brother to exceed his personal expectations.","Address

Pi Tau Sigma-Wisconsin Alpha Chapter,"Pi Tau Sigma is an international honor society of top Juniors and Seniors in Mechanical Engineering. There are over 160 chapters from universities across North America. It was co-founded by our chapter in 1915 with four basic goals: History: With the twentieth century came the realization that honor societies made a definite contribution to the department and that membership required active participation. Pi Tau Sigma came into being on March 16, 1915, at the University of Illinois. A similar organization embarked November 15, 1915, at Wisconsin and other local organizations (such as the Carzeuran of Purdue) were soon to become active. The early leaders: Professors C.R. Richards, A.C. Willard, and O.A. Leutwiler of the University of Illinois; G.L. Larson of the University of Wisconsin; G.A. Young of Purdue University; and J.V. Martenis of the University of Minnesota, stand out for their early contributions. In ten years Pi Tau Sigma grew to six chapters in the middlewest (Illinois Alpha, Wisconsin Alpha, Purdue Beta, Minnesota Gamma, Illinois Delta, and Missouri Epsilon). In 1925 the expansion continued to the east with the Penn State Zeta Chapter being installed. Six years later the Texas Kappa Chapter, and the following year the Colorado Mu Chapter established chapters in the south and west. Also in 1932 the expansion continued southeast to Georgia Tech Nu Chapter. It was not until nine years later that the first chapter was installed on the Pacific coast (Oregon State Omega). In twenty-six years Pi Tau Sigma became truly a national mechanical engineering honor society with a total of twenty-five chapters. During the succeeding four years nine additional chapters were installed. From 1947 to 1958 forty new chapters were installed. The Chapter-At-Large was established in 1954. The installations completed thus far bring the total established chapters to one hundred and fifty-seven. O.C.K. Hutchinson, University of Illinois, and J.B. Wilkinson, University of Wisconsin, met early in 1916 to arrange plans for making the organization national, under the name of Pi Tau Sigma. The coalition took place in Chicago, March 12, 1916, at which the matter if chapter designation was decided and the two chapters become Illinois Alpha and Wisconsin Alpha. ","Address

Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacy Student Interest Group,"The primary objectives of our student interest group are the following: Educational opportunities, community outreach and service, mental health and wellness promotion and pharmacist career exploration. On the foundational level of our operations we are focusing on providing members of our interest group with educational opportunities to learn about current topics in psychiatric and neurological pharmacy. These educational opportunities are sourced from local experts in the field as well as faculty at the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy. We provide these educational opportunities through student interest group meetings and faculty led journal clubs. Coupled with educational opportunities, we conduct community service and outreach projects to advance pharmacists’ involvement in psychiatric and neurological conditions. Our student group strongly feels that one of the biggest barriers that patients with psychiatric and neurological conditions face is a lack of awareness of their conditions. Therefore, we partner with community organizations with existing outreach infrastructure to provide advocacy and patient support for those with psychiatric and neurological conditions. Part of our mission as future pharmacists working in this field is to promote mental health & wellness for our members as well as the entire School of Pharmacy. We play a pivotal role in putting on wellness week each year as well as posting articles, self care tips, and other information to promote well being to our wellness wall and brochures around the school. To give back to our member base, we provide networking and career exploration opportunities. We accomplish this by networking with local pharmacists involved with psychiatric and neurologic pharmacy and coordinating shadowing opportunities. Further, we use various student interest group meetings to bring in current psychiatric and neurological pharmacists to discuss their role in patient care.","Address Address Contact Email

Sales & Trading and Asset Management Club,"STAM’s goal is to find a group of highly passionate and motivated students pursuing careers in Sales & Trading and Asset Management and place its students at financial institutions. Based on the experience of the primary contacts for this organization, recruitment for these positions in New York and Chicago is highly selective. To be successful, a student not only must learn the financial aspect, but also must engage in arduous networking and extra-cirricular work to demonstrate an intellectual curiosity toward the subject. Based on conversations with numerous alumni, they are only able to help so much – a student must also demonstrate they are polished and educated enough to be successful in an internship position. Club members will develop in two ways: professionally and subject-specific. With the help of alumni (who are eager to help this organization), students will spend time improving networking skills and participate in outside case-studies to get a first-hand education. At each weekly meeting (running 1 hour to 1.5 hours), half the time will be spent for each development purpose. Professional development will consist of resume editing, communication improvement, emailing practices, and do’s/dont’s of networking. The latter half of each session will consist of a discussion of weekly market movements (Dow, S&P, and commodities) and the drivers behind the movements. We will go through sell-side research reports and publish our own findings based on real-world data. Students will also take the free Bloomberg Market Concepts course in the library to enhance their understanding for the markets. As the semester progresses, we will be speaking with alumni in S&T and Asset Management about their work/experiences, and get their perspectives on the markets to further enhance the education of our members. In the spring semester, sophomores and juniors will travel to New York City and Chicago to meet with the sales and trading and asset management divisions across numerous banks. Our core goal: to increase the presence of badgers in the financial services industry.","Address

Shorin-Ryu Karate Club,"If you are looking to learn self defense, or just a fun way to get fit, show up at any of our practice sessions! Your first semester is entirely free of charge! As of Fall 2023, we've moved our roster from WIN to DoSportsEasy. Register for the club here! This Fall 2024, we'll meet at the Bakke Recreation & Wellbeing Center Tuesdays in the Classroom from 8-10 pm, as well as Saturdays in Tempo Studio from 10am-12pm. Come by any time, no experience is necessary!  Shorin-Ryu Karate is a club sport that has been teaching students martial arts skills since 1972. Currently we have several Senseis (teachers), many of whom are students and staff at the university. Students in this class come from all walks of life, sharing the common desire to study a martial art. The ultimate goals of this dojo are to teach personal self-protection skills, improve physical fitness, share the rich history of the Shorin-Ryu martial arts, and to create a learning environment for self-mastery. During a typical class, students start with some warm-up drills and body-weight fitness exercises, then practice a wide variety of techniques through kata (drills) and bunkai (practical applications).We utilize individual drills, partner drills, and group drills. Sometimes, we engage in light to moderate contact and kobudo, or the ancient weapons of karate like bo, sai, nunchaku, tonfa etc. The study of kata is central to the martial arts, and a fundamental part of our curriculum. Kata are the forms which illustrate how individual techniques are put together to defend ourselves if ever the need should arise. The kata, which may be interpreted as a sequence of simple offensive techniques (e.g. punching, grappling, throwing etc.), have more subtle interpretations. The Okinawan masters who studied this art developed pressure point and joint manipulations that allow a karateka to control a much larger opponent. Our dojo studies these techniques, and integrates them into an effective personal self-defense system. Typically, new students participate in learning pressure point methods and joint locks right away. Our first three kata are readily accessible to new students. Rank is not based strictly on how long a student has studied martial arts, but rather by ability to perform kata and explain bunkai (applications). On average, a new student can assimilate the entire introductory curriculum within one or two semesters. This represents proficiency at basic techniques and selected kata. Advanced students may study the kobudo, or the ancient weapons as training devices, although emphasis is still placed on the effective use of empty hands (kara-te) to defend oneself. Additionally, advanced students earn teaching responsibilities. A student's training culminates in his or her black belt test, which represents proficiency in karate. Really, however, the black belt is only a beginning of another journey, into the great breadth and depth of the martial arts. Teaching tangible self-defense skills in a friendly, collegiate atmosphere, Shorin-Ryu Karate Club draws on the strength of its members to enhance the martial arts experience. Although we pride ourselves on training in the traditional Okinawan skills, we also incorporate modern methods into our training to assure the best class content possible. We attend a few local tournaments, and individuals are encouraged to explore seminars that come to the Chicago area. Since we associate with a second Shorin-Ryu dojo (located at the YMCA), we enjoy a great sharing of knowledge, skill and camaraderie. We are always happy to welcome new members.

Sigma Chi - Lambda,"In 1855, seven young men, Benjamin Piatt Runkle, Thomas Cowan Bell, William Lewis Lockwood, Isaac M. Jordan, Daniel William Cooper, Franklin Howard Scobey and James Parks Caldwell, wanted something better in a fraternity during their collegiate experience, and from that recognition, a dream was born — the fraternity of Sigma Chi. In short, Sigma Chi began because good men chose to act. Our seven Founders recognized that a principle-driven lifestyle should be paramount in an individual’s lifelong quest to achieve progressive development, and that the world in which they lived had a great need for ethical leaders whose core principles were based on the possession of remarkable character. Sigma Chi’s story has been building on itself since 1855 and, indeed, the Fraternity has changed dramatically since that time. When those seven college students gathered together for the first time, there were no telephones, no automobiles, no planes, no Internet, not even electricity — essentially, their lives were devoid of any of the modern amenities we are used to. Yet, somehow, they prospered. Without iPhones, the Internet, rapid transit, or even the possibility of an immediate connection outside of the small town of Oxford, Ohio, and their roughly 300 fellow students, they somehow knew that they had planted the seed for something amazing to grow. Through it all, they found in themselves and each other an uncommon strength of character to pursue a dream and to pass that dream on to other young men who would carry it forward. Their dream was simple — to enhance the leadership abilities of men by refining their character through the framework of Friendship, Justice and Learning — our three guiding principles. Seven young men set the foundation for a lifelong course of development that has since provided more than 300,000 men with the structure to understand how to make a positive influence on the world. The ranks of Sigma Chis now include titans of industry, celebrities, political leaders, husbands, fathers, brothers and many more. Each member brings so many different characteristics to the world, yet we all bring the same endowment of character that our world today so badly needs. Principle-driven leaders are needed now more than ever before, and the fact that Sigma Chi makes a concerted effort to contribute to the development of such men is what makes the Fraternity so important today.

Steel Bridge Team of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,"The National Student Steel Bridge Competition is an annual competition amongst approximately 200 schools across North America which challenges engineering students to design, fabricate, and build a 1:10 scale steel bridge that conforms to the specifications laid out in the competition rules. These rules change each year to keep the competition fresh and exciting. Bridges are scored at competitions based on Construction Economy and Structural Efficiency. The goal is to build a bridge that is strong, light, and easy to put together. The fall semester is spent designing the bridge using the popular structural analysis program SAP2000. Team members are taught the fundamentals of the program during meetings, and are encouraged to assist in the design of the bridge. We also utilize the TEAM Lab to fabricate our own member connections, and many team members complete the requirements for obtaining their ""Intro to Machining"" training, allowing them access to the shop. After the structural design is complete, the bridge is drawn in AutoCAD and a complete plan set is created. The plans are then brought to a local manufacturing company over winter break, who generously helps members fabricate the bridge for one week in January. Spring semester is spent modifying the bridge and practicing construction runs. One of the goals of the competition is to put the bridge, which is fabricated in pieces, together as fast as possible. We spend months practicing so that we are as fast as possible at competitions. The team competes in a regional competition, typically in early April, and hopefully a national competition in June. This year, our regional event will be in Chicago between UIC and IIT, and nationals are at Brigham Young University. The UW-Madison team has been very successful, competing in the national competition 20+ years in a row. This year we are looking for lots of new members to assist in the design, fabrication and construction our bridge. We have lofty goals set for this school year and we are going to need a lot of involvement to achieve them. If you are interested in joining, please contact us via e-mail at steelbridgeuw@gmail.com or attend one of our meetings. We hope to hear from you, and On Wisconsin!","Address

Taekwondo Club - UW Madison,"If you wish to join our club please register HERE. We can no longer add people to the roster on WIN. Thank you! About Taekwondo: Taekwondo is a martial art which emphasizes kicking and hand techniques from an upright, highly mobile stance. Developed in Korea, and practiced by over 7 million people worldwide, it is also a highly competitive Olympic Sport. We are the official Taekwondo Club of UW-Madison. As an official Sport Club, our competition team represents UW-Madison at various local and regional tournaments as well as the National Collegiate Taekwondo Championship. However, we do not require members to compete. Every year we have many students join who are simply looking to learn a fun new sport, make friends, and get in shape. We are affiliated with the World Taekwondo Federation (the Olympic) style Taekwondo. We are taught by very experienced instructors, drawn from University staff and the student body. All of our instructors are Kukkiwon certified black belts and most of them have cross trained in multiple martial arts. Our instructors work hard to balance a traditional approach to martial arts training and the dynamic, quick, and explosive kicking style of full-contact Olympic sparring. Beyond the striking elements of Taekwondo, our club also emphasizes throws, breakfalls, joint-locks, and other techniques necessary to a well rounded self defense and martial arts program. We also provide opportunities for students to get involved on campus and in the local community through fundraising for charities, volunteering at our self-defense seminars, and much more. Our Mission: The mission of the Taekwondo Club of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is to instruct members in the techniques and tenets of Taekwondo; to provide opportunity for competitive members to represent the university at an elite level; and, to facilitate an environment where member growth positively impacts the team, the university, and the community.

Our community is a great platform for…   A note about Intellectual Property and collaborating in Transcend: Intellectual Property is a catch-all term for the creative work you have done – idea drawings, engineering designs, program specifications, business model, the ‘how it works’ part of your idea. We want you to protect your IP while still being open to sharing ideas and collaboration. We have no set policy regarding non-disclosure agreements or keeping things secret. We want you to share your idea. If you’re afraid of the idea getting taken, then you don’t have to share your entire ‘secret sauce’ recipe with everyone. In other words, Ford could have talked about his ‘assembly line’ idea without getting into the details of creating one. To create conversation and brainstorming, you only need to describe at a very high-altitude view what you’re doing, not the nitty gritty details. You can save your IP while being open about your ideas – it is possible. And in today’s knowledge economy, the only way to collaborate is by sharing ideas. No idea can be 100% original and uninfluenced by prior ideas. If someone ‘steals’ your idea, it probably means they are using parts of your idea, parts of prior ideas and parts of their own ideas to make something that is much different than your original intention. That’s the spirit of creativity! Sharing ideas and sparking other product ideas. If you decide to work with other students, you control that relationship 100% and should talk about IP sharing and what you think is acceptable. At this point you should reach out to the UW Law & Entrepreneurship clinic which gives free legal advice (and told us to tell you they want to hear your ideas!).","Address Address Contact Email

Turning Point USA Chapter at UW-Madison,"Turning Point USA starts conversations among young people, by educating students about fiscal responsibility, free markets, and capitalism. Through non-partisan debate, dialogue, and discussion, Turning Point USA believes that every young person can be enlightened to true free market values.  WE BELIEVE: In Balanced Budgets
A country, business, or family should not spend more money than it takes in. High debts ruin economic potential, plague private investment, and jeopardize the future generations chance to enjoy prosperity.  WE BELIEVE: In an Informed Electorate
The greatest solution to combating generational theft is an electorate that understands the issues, civics, and basic governmental policy. With a more informed electorate, old political talking points of the past will no longer be viable, candidates will be forced to stand behind their principles, and pressured to execute beneficial public policy.  WE BELIEVE: In the Power of the Youth
With over 46 million younger voters eligible to vote in 2012 alone and millions more each year, younger generations are this country’s fastest growing demographic. If we do not target the youth, debts will become a thing of habit, and our republic forever lost.  WE BELIEVE: In an Independent Approach
Turning Point USA does not stand on party, rather on principle. Both sides of the aisle are responsible for reckless spending and trillion dollar deficits. It is now time for a resurgent citizen force to take action against such politicians by educating the electorate about the theft that has been occurring.  WE BELIEVE: That tomorrow is brighter
No matter how deep the hole, or gloomy the day, never bet against America. The power of freedom and liberty is a force that can overcome a government bureaucrat, agency, or even politician. The root of Turning Point USA is an optimistic approach, and the core belief that tomorrow will be more prosperous.  Types of Events: The Turning Point USA Chapter will be hosting speakers and debates to explore and understand free-market principles and current events.  We will also be participating in campus activism activities such as tabling and chalking.  The purpose of the activities is to spread awareness and knowledge about free markets, fiscal responsibility and capitalism.","Address Address Contact Email

Our modern world is the product of rapid technological advancement. We believe that AI is going to be a revolutionary technology – perhaps of greater magnitude than the agriculture and industrial revolutions. It has a high potential to improve human flourishing, but also the capability to cause a lot of harm at every step of the way.   Already, today, there are ongoing downsides due to AI: systemic discrimination, privacy, misinformation, surveillance. As the technology advances, the scale of potential harm does as well.   A particular landmark to beware will be the creation of agentic general intelligences. While it sounds impossible or far off, it may be on the horizon: 90% of experts predict a 50% likelihood of human-level AI within the century, at least half forecast the same chance before 2061. Many leading AI companies – such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic – predict at around 2030.   We believe that having a holistic understanding of the risks that come with AI is practical and necessary for one to have a positive impact in any AI-related career. WAISI intends to be a space for people to grow the understanding of, and skills to mitigate, those risks.","Address Address Contact Email

A dedicated Intel server processes the data and sends commands to the vehicle's motor controller and steering/braking actuators. Aside from a great way to meet and work with other students that share your passion, the skills learned at Wisconsin Autonomous relate directly to coursework and help you to develop the all-valuable engineering skill: teamwork and communication.

Wisconsin Biosecurity Initiative,"The Wisconsin Biosecurity Initiative (WBI) is an interdisciplinary group that brings students together to mitigate the increasingly prevalent threat posed by infectious disease.  As evident by the historic COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases have the capacity to shut down societies: interrupting critical supply chains, destabilizing economies, and leading to massive loss of life. While the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has fallen considerably from its peak, additional, potentially even more lethal pandemics may be just around the corner - waiting to spill over from a non-human host, being stored in an insecure laboratory, or perhaps being created using increasingly available genetic engineering tools. To prevent these pathogens from triggering the next global pandemic , experts in epidemiology, public health, biology, environmental science, medicine, law, and numerous other fields must collaborate closely to surveil pathogens, effectively manage outbreaks, develop vaccines, and respond promptly to emerging threats.  Helping students get their start in these fields is the core of the Wisconsin Biosecurity Initiative which offers mentored research and project teams, a vast professional network, as well as internship, publishing and grant opportunities – our goal is to kickstart your career!","Address

Wisconsin Equestrian Team,"Wisconsin Equestrian is made up of a team of approximately 20 riders from all backgrounds and disciplines. Experience levels range from horse lovers who have never had the chance to take up riding to those who have been successful in the upper levels of equitation, hunters, and jumpers. Although the Wisconsin Equestrian Team rides and competes in hunt seat equitation, members of ALL disciplines are welcome and encouraged to tryout.  Each member gets an average of 1 hour of riding time per week, and extra lessons can be scheduled with the Hoofer Riding Club. Wisconsin Equestrian Team uses the horses and facility of Sugar Creek Stables, located in Brooklyn, WI. It is not necessary to have a car in order to join the team as carpools are organized for every event including lessons, practices, socials, and horse shows.  The team provides a great social network as our season spans the entire school year, rather than just a semester. Wisconsin Equestrian also plans multiple social events throughout the year so everyone may get to know each other and create a bond of friendship and team competition.  Time Commitment The time commitment for the Wisconsin Equestrian Team is a perfect balance between work and play, providing team members with several opportunities to ride while still maintaining plenty of time for their studies.  Lessons Team members are divided into lesson groups of maximum 4-5 people and take one-hour long lesson a week with a coach. If the coach must cancel a lesson due to an emergency or unsafe weather conditions, the lesson will be rescheduled for a later date in the semester. If a rider misses their lesson, they are responsible for making it up on their own. Lessons are held at Sugar Creek Stables. * For lessons, riders must commit additional time to groom and tack up horses before the scheduled riding time and untack and cool down horses after. This usually adds an additional hour to lessons.  Transportation Sugar Creek Stables is located in Brooklyn, WI, which is about 40 minutes away from the UW-Madison Campus. Team members carpool to the barn for lessons and practices, so owning a car is not necessary.  Horse Shows Wisconsin Equestrian competes in approximately ten horse shows throughout the school year. These are generally held across five weekends. As riders continue to improve and show dedication to the team, show teams will change throughout the school year. Therefore, not every team member will compete at every show.  Social Events Meetings are held on Wednesdays at 7 PM bi-weekly. Our social chairs also organize at least one social event per month in order to foster team bonding and friendship.  Financial Commitment The Wisconsin Equestrian Team does not receive sponsorship money from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Therefore, most of our funds come from fundraising efforts, the generous donations of friends and family members, and the pockets of our team members. In order to help future members prepare for the financial commitment of being on the team, we have put together a rough estimate based on costs from previous years. Please note that costs are subject to change throughout the year.  Lessons: $35 each (Members are required to take 22 per year) Hoofer Club Membership: $125 per year IHSA Membership: $45 per year Driver gas money (not applicable if you are a driver): approximately $50 per semester Horse Shows: approximately $200 per weekend (Includes entry fees, hotel, food, and fleet rental)  Of course, these expenses are spread out throughout both semesters, and payment plans are available to help alleviate financial concerns. This estimate does not include Tournament of Champions series horse shows, Regionals, Zones, or Nationals. The Wisconsin Equestrian Team participates in several fundraising events to help offset the costs of practices and horse shows.","Address

"Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender & Society","The Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender & Society grew out of two traditions: the University of Wisconsin Law School’s “law in action” approach and the interdisciplinary design of gender studies. Through “law in action” we look beyond the statutes and cases to study the practical effects of the law on individuals, marginalized communities, and society at large. The interdisciplinary approach, with an emphasis on gender identity, offers different perspectives through which to expand and challenge our understanding of the law and its implications on society. The Journal, originally the Wisconsin Women’s Law Journal, one of the earliest in the nation devoted to the study of women and the law, has strived to contribute insightful scholarship to this evolving field of study. Recognizing that women are a diverse group with differing beliefs and interests, and moreover that gender stereotyping and gender identity discrimination of any kind inhibits each individual’s full equality under the law, we encourage articles that examine the intersection of law and gender with issues of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.","Address

YesUW,"YesUW is based on the principles of the YouTube Channel Yes Theory and the process of  seeking discomfort. We believe that the key to forming deeper connections and creating more fulfilling experiences require stepping outside our comfort zones. By going outside our comfort zones, we can see new perspectives and shake us out of our daily lives. Doing so reminds  us that our day to day routine isn’t the only thing that is out there. As Yes Theory says, “Break out of your routine, and you’ll find new creative energy.” These change-ups allow us to see the world in a new light and can inspire new ideas. The only issue with trying new experiences is that they can be uncomfortable. We sit in our day to day lives thinking why go out and try something new, that seems like so much work. It's easy to find a million reasons to say no, it’s hard to say yes.  And yet, we find ourselves bored with that day to day life. To find fulfillment, we have to go outside our comfort zones. We want to be the facilitator for these experiences so that  everyone who is inspired will be able to seek discomfort and fulfillment on a regular basis.","Address
